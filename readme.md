This is a scheduler for Uninett WebApplication Park (UWAP). It requires users to be logged in via FEIDE and stores events created in the personal database. It is also possible to view ical-calendars from other URIs and calendars from the user's Google Calendar account, as well as UNINETT-calendars if the user is a member of the UNINETT-group.
