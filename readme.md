This is a scheduler for Uninett WebApp Park (UWAP). It requires users to be logged in via FEIDE and stores events created in the personal database. It is also possible to view ical-calendars from other URIs (using UWAP's API for getting cross-domain data) and calendars from the user's Google Calendar account(using UWAP's built-in Oauth2-handling), as well as UNINETT-calendars if the user is a member of the UNINETT-group.
